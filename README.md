Play as a dice painting a canvas in a 3D world. Brushed is [@cademidyett](https://github.com/cademidyett) and my submission 
for the [GMTK 2022 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022). 

Each side of the dice has a colored side. When the colored side touches the canvas, it paints the canvas. The goal is
to paint a picture using the position, as well as colors on the dice.
